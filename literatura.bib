    abstract="Machine learning is synonymous with advanced computing and a growing body of work exists on the use of such techniques to solve real-world problems [e.g., Tsoukalas {\&} Uhrig, 1997]. The complex and/or ill-understood nature of many problem domains, such as data mining or process control, has led to the need for technologies which can adapt to the task they face. Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) [Holland, 1976] are a machine learning technique which combines reinforcement learning, evolutionary computing and other heuristics to produce adaptive systems. The subject of this book is the use of LCS for real-world applications.",
